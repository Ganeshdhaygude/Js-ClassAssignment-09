JavaScript Functionality
The JavaScript code in the HTML file handles the interaction between the dropdown menus and the <div> element. Here's a breakdown of the functionality used:

Event Listeners: Each dropdown menu is associated with an event listener that listens for the "change" event when an option is selected.

DOM Manipulation: When an option is selected in a dropdown, the corresponding property of the <div> element is updated using DOM manipulation. For example, when a color is selected in the "Choose Text Color" dropdown, the style.color property of the <div> element is updated.

getElementById: The getElementById method is used to get references to the dropdown menus and the <div> element in the HTML.

addEventListener: The addEventListener method is used to attach event listeners to the dropdown menus. These listeners trigger the corresponding functions when an option is selected.
